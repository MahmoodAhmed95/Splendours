User stories 

1. Regular User:
   As a regular user of the bidding app, I want to be able to scroll through pictures of auctioned items, so I can easily see what's up for bid. I also want the ability to place bids on items that interest me and write reviews about items I've won in auctions. Being able to interact with the app's features easily and leave feedback on my transactions is important to me.

2. Business Account User:
   As a business account user on the bidding app, I need to be able to post new auction items, including uploading images and setting auction durations. This way, I can showcase the items my business is offering and create engaging auctions for potential buyers. It's essential that I have control over the process to ensure the success of my auctions and reach a wider audience.

3. Admin User;
   As an admin of the bidding app, I require complete authorisation and oversight over the platform. I need the ability to monitor user activities, verify successful transactions, and ensure that users are adhering to the rules. If I come across any suspicious or fraudulent activities, I need the authority to ban users to maintain a safe and secure environment. Additionally, I should be able to manage categories, delete accounts when necessary, and have access to tools that facilitate smooth operations of the platform. This comprehensive control will enable me to keep the app running smoothly and create a trustworthy user experience.
